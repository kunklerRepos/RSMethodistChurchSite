        <h4 id="Trinity">1. Faith in the Holy Trinity</h4>
        <p>We believe in the one living and true God, both holy and loving, eternal, unlimited in power, wisdom,
        and goodness, the Creator and Preserver of all things. Within this unity there are three persons of one
        essential nature, power and eternity—the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</p>
        
        <h4 id="Father">2. The Father</h4>
        <p>We believe the Father is the Source of all that exists, whether of matter or spirit. With the Son and the
            Holy Spirit, He made man, male and female, in His image. By intention He relates to people as Father,
            thereby forever declaring His goodwill toward them. In love, He both seeks and receives penitent
            sinners.</p>    

        <h4 id="Son">3. The Son</h4>
        <p>We believe in Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God. He was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born
        of the Virgin Mary, truly God and truly man. He died on the cross and was buried, to be a sacrifice both
        for original sin and for all human transgressions, and to reconcile us to God. Christ rose bodily from the
        dead, and ascended into heaven, and there intercedes for us at the Father’s right hand until He returns
        to judge all humanity at the last day.</p>

        <h4 id="HolySpirit">4. The Holy Spirit</h4>
        <p>We believe in the Holy Spirit who proceeds from the Father and the Son, and is of the same essential
        nature, majesty, and glory, as the Father and the Son, truly and eternally God. He is the Administrator of
        grace to all, and is particularly the effective Agent in conviction for sin, in regeneration, in sanctification,
        and in glorification. He is ever present, assuring, preserving, guiding, and enabling the believer.</p>

        <h4 id="SolaFide">5. The Sufficiency and Full Authority of the Holy Scriptures for Salvation</h4>
        <p>We believe that the books of the Old and New Testaments constitute the Holy Scriptures. They are the
        inspired and infallibly written Word of God, fully inerrant in their original manuscripts and superior to all
        human authority, and have been transmitted to the present without corruption of any essential
        doctrine. We believe that they contain all things necessary to salvation; so that whatever is not read
        therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be required of any man or woman that it should be
        believed as an article of faith, or be thought requisite or necessary to salvation. Both in the Old and New
        Testaments life is offered ultimately through Christ, who is the only Mediator between God and
        humanity. The New Testament teaches Christians how to fulfill the moral principles of the Old
        Testament, calling for loving obedience to God made possible by the indwelling presence of His Holy
        Spirit.

        The canonical books of the Old Testament are:
        Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1 Samuel, 2 Samuel, 1 Kings, 2
        Kings, 1 Chronicles, 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, The Song

        </p>
        
        <h4 id="Purose">6. God’s Purpose for Humanity</h4>
        <p>We believe that the two great commandments which require us to love the Lord our God with all the
        heart, and our neighbors as ourselves, summarize the divine law as it is revealed in the Scriptures. They
        are the perfect measure and norm of human duty, both for the ordering and directing of families and
        nations, and all other social bodies, and for individual acts, by which we are required to acknowledge
        God as our only Supreme Ruler, and all persons as created by Him, equal in all natural rights. Therefore
        all persons should so order all their individual, social, and political acts as to give to God entire and
        absolute obedience, and to assure to all the enjoyment of every natural right, as well as to promote the
        fulfillment of each in the possession and exercise of such rights.</p>

        <h4 id="Family">7. Marriage and the Family</h4>
        <p>We believe that every person is created in the image of God, that human sexuality reflects that image in
        terms of intimate love, communication, fellowship, subordination of the self to the larger whole, and
        fulfillment. God’s Word makes use of the marriage relationship as the supreme metaphor for His
        relationship with His covenant people and for revealing the truth that this relationship is of one God
        with one people. Therefore God’s plan for human sexuality is that it is to be expressed only in a
        monogamous lifelong relationship between one man and one woman within the framework of
        marriage. This is the only relationship which is divinely designed for the birth and rearing of children and
        is a covenant union made in the sight of God, taking priority over every other human relationship.</p>

        <h4 id="PersonalChoice">8. Personal Choice</h4>
        <p>
        We believe that humanity’s creation in the image of God included ability to choose between right and
        wrong. Thus individuals were made morally responsible for their choices. But since the fall of Adam,
        people are unable in their own strength to do the right. This is due to original sin, which is not simply the
        following of Adam’s example, but rather the corruption of the nature of each mortal, and is reproduced
        naturally in Adam’s descendants. Because of it, humans are very far gone from original righteousness,
        and by nature are continually inclined to evil. They cannot of themselves even call upon God or exercise
        faith for salvation. But through Jesus Christ the prevenient grace of God makes possible what humans in
        self effort cannot do. It is bestowed freely upon all, enabling all who will to turn and be saved.
        </p>

        <h4 id="Sin">9. Sin: Original, Willful, and Involuntary</h4>
        <p>We believe that through the disobedience of Adam and Eve sin entered the world and all creation
        suffered its consequences. The effects of sin include disruption of the relationship between God and
        humanity, deterioration of the natural order of creation, and exploitation of persons by evil or
        misguided social systems. The whole of creation groans for redemption. Each person is born with a
        proclivity toward sin, manifested in an inordinate orientation toward self and independence from God,
        leading to deliberate acts of unrighteousness. The residual effects of Adam and Eve’s disobedience
        include a marred human nature from which arise involuntary shortcomings, faults, infirmities, and
        imperfect judgments, which should not be accounted the same as willful sin. However, as
        manifestations of the fallen nature of humanity, these shortcomings of God’s holiness still necessitate
        the merits of the atonement, the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit, and the self-control of the believer.
        Willful sin results when a morally accountable person chooses to violate a known law of God, using
        freedom of choice to please self rather than obey God. The consequences of willful sin include a loss of
        fellowship with God, a self-absorption with one’s own interests rather than love and concern for others,
        a bondage to things which distort the divine image, a persistent inability to live righteously, and
        ultimately everlasting misery and separation from God. The atoning work of Christ is the only remedy for
        sin, whether original, willful or involuntary.</p>

        <h4 id="Atonement">10. The Atonement</h4>
        <p>We believe that Christ’s offering of himself, once and for all, through His sufferings and meritorious
            death on the cross, provides the perfect redemption and atonement for the sins of the whole world,
            both original and actual. There is no other ground of salvation from sin but that alone. This atonement is
            sufficient for every individual of Adam’s race. It is unconditionally effective in the salvation of those
            mentally incompetent from birth, of those converted persons who have become mentally incompetent,
            and of children under the age of accountability. But it is effective for the salvation of those who reach
            the age of accountability only when they repent and exercise faith in Christ.</p>
        
        <h4 id="Repentance">11. Repentance and Faith</h4>
        <p>We believe that for men and women to appropriate what God’s prevenient grace has made possible,
        they must voluntarily respond in repentance and faith. The ability comes from God, but the act is the
        individual’s.
        Repentance is prompted by the convicting ministry of the Holy Spirit. It involves a willful change of mind
        that renounces sin and longs for righteousness, a godly sorrow for and a confession of past sins, proper
        restitution for wrongdoings, and a resolution to reform the life. Repentance is the precondition for
        saving faith, and without it saving faith is impossible. Faith, in turn, is the only condition of salvation. It
        begins in the agreement of the mind and the consent of the will to the truth of the gospel, but issues in
        a complete reliance by the whole person in the saving ability of Jesus Christ and a complete trusting of
        oneself to Him as Savior and Lord. Saving faith is expressed in a public acknowledgment of His Lordship
        and an identification with His Church.</p>

        <h4 id="Justification">12. Justification, Regeneration and Adoption</h4>
        <p>
        We believe that when one repents of personal sin and believes on the Lord Jesus Christ, that at the
            same moment that person is justified, regenerated, adopted into the family of God, and assured of
            personal salvation through the witness of the Holy Spirit.
            We believe that justification is the judicial act of God whereby a person is accounted righteous, granted
            full pardon of all sin, delivered from guilt, completely released from the penalty of sins committed, by
            the merit of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, by faith alone, not on the basis of works.
            We believe that regeneration, or the new birth, is that work of the Holy Spirit whereby, when one truly
            repents and believes, one’s moral nature is given a distinctively spiritual life with the capacity for love
            and obedience. This new life is received by faith in Jesus Christ, it enables the pardoned sinner to serve
            God with the will and affections of the heart, and by it the regenerate are delivered from the power of
            sin which reigns over all the unregenerate.
            We believe that adoption is the act of God by which the justified and regenerated believer becomes a
            partaker of all the rights, privileges, and responsibilities of a child of God.
        </p>

        <h4 id="GoodWorks">13. Good Works</h4>
        <p>We believe that although good works cannot save us from our sins or from God’s judgment, they are the
        fruit of faith and follow after regeneration. Therefore they are pleasing and acceptable to God in Christ,
        and by them a living faith may be as evidently known as a tree is discerned by its fruit.</p>

        <h4 id="Regeneration">14. Sin After Regeneration</h4>
        <p>
        We believe that after we have experienced regeneration, it is possible to fall into sin, for in this life there
        is no such height or strength of holiness from which it is impossible to fall. But by the grace of God one
        who has fallen into sin may by true repentance and faith find forgiveness and restoration.
        </p>

        <h4 id="Sanctification">15. Sanctification: Initial, Progressive, Entire</h4>
        <p>We believe that sanctification is that work of the Holy Spirit by which the child of God is separated from
        sin unto God and is enabled to love God with all the heart and to walk in all His holy commandments
        blameless. Sanctification is initiated at the moment of justification and regeneration. From that moment
        there is a gradual or progressive sanctification as the believer walks with God and daily grows in grace
        and in a more perfect obedience to God. This prepares for the crisis of entire sanctification which is
        wrought instantaneously when believers present themselves as living sacrifices, holy and acceptable to
        God, through faith in Jesus Christ, being effected by the baptism with the Holy Spirit who cleanses the
        heart from all inbred sin. The crisis of entire sanctification perfects the believer in love and empowers
        that person for effective service. It is followed by lifelong growth in grace and the knowledge of our Lord
        and Savior, Jesus Christ. The life of holiness continues through faith in the sanctifying blood of Christ and
        evidences itself by loving obedience to God’s revealed will.</p>

        <h4 id="Spirit">16. The Gifts of the Spirit</h4>
        <p>
        We believe that the Gift of the Spirit is the Holy Spirit himself, and He is to be desired more than the
        gifts of the Spirit which He in His wise counsel bestows upon individual members of the Church to
        enable them properly to fulfill their function as members of the body of Christ. The gifts of the Spirit,
        although not always identifiable with natural abilities, function through them for the edification of the
        whole Church. These gifts are to be exercised in love under the administration of the Lord of the Church,
        not through human volition. The relative value of the gifts of the Spirit is to be tested by their usefulness
        in the Church and not by the ecstasy produced in the ones receiving them. 
        </p>

        <h4 id="Church">17. The Church</h4>
        <p>
        We believe that the Christian Church is the entire body of believers in Jesus Christ, who is the founder
        and only Head of the Church. The Church includes both those believers who have gone to be with the
        Lord and those who remain on the earth, having renounced the world, the flesh, and the devil, and
        having dedicated themselves to the work which Christ committed unto His church until He comes. The
        Church on earth is to preach the pure Word of God, properly administer the sacraments according to
        Christ’s instructions, and live in obedience to all that Christ commands. A local church is a body of
        believers formally organized on gospel principles, meeting regularly for the purposes of evangelism,
        nurture, fellowship, and worship. The Independent Methodist Church is a church consisting of those
        members within the local church who, as members of the body of Christ, hold the faith set forth in these
        Articles of Religion and acknowledge the ecclesiastical authority of its governing bodies.
        </p>

        <h4 id="Sacraments">18. The Sacraments: Baptism and the Lord’s Supper</h4>
        <p>We believe that water baptism and the Lord’s Supper are the sacraments of the church commanded by
            Christ and ordained as a means of grace when received through faith. They are tokens of our profession
            of Christian faith and signs of God’s gracious ministry toward us. By them, He works within us to
            quicken, strengthen, and confirm our faith.
            We believe that water baptism is a sacrament of the church, commanded by our Lord and administered
            to believers. It is a symbol of the new covenant of grace and signifies acceptance of the benefits of the
            atonement of Jesus Christ. By means of this sacrament, believers declare their faith in Jesus Christ as
            Savior.
            We believe that the Lord’s Supper is a sacrament of our redemption by Christ’s death and of our hope in
            His victorious return, as well as a sign of the love that Christians have for each other. To such as receive
            it humbly, with a proper spirit and by faith, the Lord’s Supper is made a means through which God
            communicates grace to the heart.</p>
        <h4 id="SecondComing">19. The Second Coming of Christ</h4>
        <p>
        We believe that the certainty of the personal and imminent return of Christ inspires holy living and zeal
        for the evangelization of the world. At His return He will fulfill all prophecies made concerning His final
        and complete triumph over evil.
        </p>

        <h4 id="Resurrection">20. The Resurrection of the Dead</h4>
        <p>
        We believe in the bodily resurrection from the dead of all people— of the just unto the resurrection of
        life, and of the unjust unto the resurrection of damnation. The resurrection of Christ is the guarantee of
        the resurrection which will occur at Christ’s Second Coming. The raised body will be a spiritual body, but
        the person will be whole and identifiable.
        </p>

        <h4 id="Judgment">21. The Judgment of All Persons</h4>
        <p>
        We believe that the Scriptures reveal God as the Judge of all and the acts of His judgment are based on
        His omniscience and eternal justice. His administration of judgment will culminate in the final meeting of
        all persons before His throne of great majesty and power, where records will be examined and final
        rewards and punishments will be administered.
        </p>

        <h4 id="Destiny">22. Destiny</h4>
        <p>
        We believe that the Scriptures clearly teach that there is a conscious personal existence after death. The
        final destiny of each person is determined by God’s grace and that person’s response, evidenced inevitably by a moral character which results from that individual’s personal and volitional choices and
        not from any arbitrary decree of God. Heaven with its eternal glory and the blessedness of Christ’s
        presence is the final abode of those who choose the salvation which God provides through Jesus Christ,
        but hell with its everlasting misery and separation from God is the final abode of those who neglect this
        great salvation.
